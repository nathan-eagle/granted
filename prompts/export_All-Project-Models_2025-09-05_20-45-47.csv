"","","1680629457571x313452839985217540","Granted simplifies the federal grant application process with AI. 

Granted’s mission is to reduce many of the tedious aspects associated with applying for federal grants. By leveraging a specialized large language model (LLM) trained on a corpus of grant proposals, Granted offers specialized data-driven guidance and suggestions to streamline repetitive aspects of proposal writing. Granted acts as an AI co-pilot, freeing up PIs to focus on their research and ideas. This time savings may also reduce the deluge of proposals submitted at or after the grant administration deadline. Granted is particularly helpful to individuals who have historically been at a disadvantage for receiving federal grants, including women, minorities, non-native English speakers, and neurodiverse applicants.


The Cost of Grant Proposals
Many of today’s top scientists and academics spend the majority of their time working on grant proposals rather than tackling real-world problems. Much of this work is repetitive and tedious, but considered a professional necessity. In 2022, it is estimated that Principal Investigators (PIs) lost 65 million hours of productivity to grant proposal writing. 

Granted has the potential to reclaim tens of millions of additional hours of productivity from our nation’s top minds. 

Funding Inequity
Federal grants are one of the most valuable career currencies in academia. However, the submission and selection process have well-known equity issues that disproportionately affect the careers of women and minority scientists. Granted addresses these issues in three ways: 1) providing equitable training to all researchers in successful submission strategies, 2) providing verbiage suggestions that may not come naturally to a non-native English speaker or an applicant with a disability such as dyslexia, 3) increasing visibility of these discrepancies within universities and funding agencies. 

Granted levels the funding playing field by making grant application processes","","",""

By doing so, the project has the potential to save millions of hours of productivity from our nation’s top researchers, while leveling the playing field for minority and underrepresented scientists applying for federal grants. In the long term, this could enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability by providing the necessary funding to support innovative research that advances our understanding of living systems' behavior.","",""

In addition, minority and underrepresented researchers face unique barriers to accessing funding resources, contributing to inequity in the distribution of grants [Add Citation]. Thus, developing an AI-driven grant application tool holds considerable promise for addressing these challenges and advancing the field.

The significance of our hypothesis lies in the potential for a novel, AI-driven platform to revolutionize the grant application process, making it more efficient and equitable for all researchers. This approach is especially relevant as the scientific community becomes more diverse and interdisciplinary, and as the funding landscape grows increasingly competitive [Add Citation]. Our project will contribute to a deeper understanding of the benefits and limitations of applying artificial intelligence to the grant application process, providing crucial insights to guide future efforts in this area.

Several knowledge gaps and opportunities exist in the current grant application landscape. For instance, the availability of personalized and relevant grant suggestions for researchers is limited, as well as the support for researchers in identifying potential collaborators and interdisciplinary perspectives. Our project aims to fill these gaps by incorporating AI-driven personalization features, recommending grants, research topics, and collaborators based on each researcher's unique expertise and interests.

By developing and implementing an AI-driven grant application tool, we aim to advance the field by demonstrating the feasibility and impact of such a solution in practice. Moreover, our project has the potential to serve as a model for the development of similar tools in other fields, fostering a more efficient, inclusive, and innovative research landscape. Additionally, our project will generate translational research opportunities by facilitating interdisciplinary connections and collaborations, ultimately leading to a greater number of high-impact projects supported by successful grant funding.

The proposed research will employ cutting-edge AI techniques and methodologies, contributing to the development and refinement of best practices in AI-driven solutions for streamlining administrative processes in research. This innovative approach not only enhances the grant application process but also provides further evidence of the transformative potential of AI across various disciplines and applications [Add Citation].

Finally, the potential impact of our project extends beyond the field of grant applications, as the successful implementation and evaluation of an AI-driven grant application tool has implications for a range of related fields, such as research administration, research funding allocation, and scientific workforce development [Add Citation]. Our long-term research plan involves expanding the AI-driven tool further to address additional challenges and opportunities, positioning our group as a leader in AI-driven solutions for scientific research.

In conclusion, the development of an AI-driven grant application tool holds significant promise for transforming the grant application process and addressing the challenges faced by researchers in securing crucial funding resources. Leveraging AI technology to streamline the process, enhance collaboration, and promote equity in the distribution of funds will propel the field forward, ultimately contributing to a more productive and inclusive scientific community.

What Gardeners Can Do

    Increase planting areas by restricting lawn to area with foot traffic and play areas. Mow at 3-4 inches and do its less often. Taller grass needs less irrigation.
    Remove invasive species as they do not contribute to the native biome and threaten native species.
    Plant keystone genera that support local ecosystems by feeding insects. Native oaks, cherries, willows, birches, cottonwoods, elms, goldenrods, asters, and perennial sunflowers are often good choices, but find out what is best for your area.
    Plant generously in large areas. Plant in layers: trees, understory trees, shrubs, and perennials.
    Plant for specialist pollinators. We need to support our 4,000 species of native bees.
    Network with neighbors. Share seeds and seedlings.
    Build conservation hardscapes: cover window wells, use motion detector outdoor lights at night, create bird-friendly baths with bubblers, place small bee hotels around the garden.
    Create caterpillar pupation sites under our trees. 90% of caterpillars drop to the ground pupating in the duff or burrowing into the soil.

We also offer a microloan program to help with equipment purchases and a refrigerated trailer that producers can borrow for product transport and temporary storage. In addition, the broader community benefits from water resource and land stewardship education events, and we act as a liaison and advocate for agriculture on many regional boards, roundtables, etc. There continue to be many challenges facing agriculture, but our organization's overall focus is balancing growth with the economic pressure of increasing land/real estate values while keeping agriculture relevant and vibrant. This pressure has only increased in recent years, spurred by the purchase of Steamboat Resort by the Alterra Mountain Company ski conglomerate and the overall shift away from urban living that occurred with the Covid19 pandemic.
   After a recent strategic evaluation by the CAA Board of Directors in response to the massive growth we have seen as an organization in the last three years, we are creating a “Local Food Hub” that will expand our services to our community. The Food Hub will grow the capacity of our organization to act as a cooperative-style distributor of local food products. The ultimate result of this expansion will be to grow and diversify revenue sources for local producers, all while connecting more consumers with their products.

"","","1681564173124x906715726476476400","Did you know that over 60% of Americans struggle with cooking healthy and flavorful meals at home? Our proposed mobile app aims to revolutionize the way people think about food and cooking by teaching them how to understand and combine flavors like professional chefs. In 2019, my team built a profitable game that teaches people how to understand, experiment with and invent new flavors like professional chefs. The app featured embedded AI 'coaches' that teach users how to make recipes taste better based on our large proprietary dataset of how real chefs learn to understand and build with flavors. Now, we are applying for an NSF SBIR grant to upgrade the app's AI chefs with a large language model (GPT-4), and relaunch the app as a gamified natural language kitchen assistant that uses large language models and a custom recommendation engine to provide personalized recommendations based on a user's preferences and nutritional needs. This innovative approach to learning about flavor combinations has the potential to revolutionize the way people think about food and cooking. By providing users with a deeper understanding of flavor profiles and how they can be combined, our game can empower users to create their own unique and healthy recipes. This has the potential to impact not only the way people cook and eat at home but also the food industry as a whole. ","The integration of large language models with a recommendation engine is a novel approach to creating a personalized learning experience for understanding and combining flavors. This innovation has the potential to impact the food industry and the way people think about food and cooking. At its core, this project is about how humans learn complex sensory languages, and how technology could help us learn them faster. When I first created Chef League, potential investors suggested turning the app into a fictional mobile cooking game and removing its learning capabilities. But the learning capabilities were important to me, so I bootstrapped it. Flavor is complex. Since 2016, I have been building the data corpus that powers Chef League. My database contains over 3000 food and beverage ingredients and 1.5 million recipes over 12 global regions, and tagged them according to their human taste, nutritional content, substitutions, flavor compounds, recipe ingredient composition, and recipe ingredient adjacencies. My original research is on human taste perception of ingredients and how professional chefs learn to categorize ingredient and recipe flavors. Some of this work went into the original Chef League app, and the app also generated new data on human taste perception. That is to say, this data corpus is large and unique, and will help us answer questions about whether and how we can learn complex sensory languages like flavor faster than through mere trial and error experiences. ","The proposed LLM-enabled mobile game for learning about cooking and flavor has the potential to appeal to a broad range of customers who are interested in learning more about flavor profiles, food combinations, and nutrition. The near-term commercial focus will be on people with existing patterns of interest in food and flavor (as evidenced by watching food shows (8 in 10 US adults), using recipe websites, buying cookbooks, playing cooking games (14.8 million) or subscribing to meal delivery plans) who are looking for a convenient and engaging way to learn more about cooking and nutrition, without having to spend hours researching and experimenting in the kitchen. These individuals often rely on takeout and pre-packaged meals, as they lack the time and knowledge to cook healthy and flavorful meals at home.  The pain points that this customer profile experiences include a lack of knowledge and confidence in their cooking abilities, a limited understanding of flavor combinations and nutrition, and a lack of time to experiment with new recipes and ingredients. The LLM-enabled, gamified kitchen assistant addresses these pain points by providing a fun and engaging way to learn about cooking and flavor, without the need for extensive research or experimentation.  By leveraging the latest advancements in natural language processing and machine learning, we can provide personalized recommendations based on the user's taste preferences and nutritional needs. This not only helps users to create healthy and flavorful meals at home but also empowers them to experiment with new ingredients and flavor combinations.","The company, Chef League, specializes in research and development in the areas of human perception of food and beverage flavors and AI-assisted human sensory learning. The CEO is Professor Beth Altringer from Brown University who has been the lead on this project for many years, the CTO is Nathan Eagle, a data science expert from MIT and accomplished entrepreneur, and our project manager is Dheeraj Sood, a software developer and project manager who we have worked with for a long time."

Clarion Court is a nursing facility that was acquired by the healthcare system in the year 1983 and gradually recorded excellent performance over the years. However, by the year 2007, the facility began facing intricate challenges mainly influenced by changes in the needs and preferences of consumers, resistance to leadership transformation, and competition from other nursing facilities. To counteract the challenge, the organization decided to restructure its leadership structure, leading to the appointment of Myra Hahn as the new administrator. After analyzing the problem, Myra proposed the restructuring of Clarion’s Court's organizational structure, an idea that was opposed by the health care system’s board of directors. She was finally replaced by Stephen Silva in the year 2009, who focused on discovering efficiencies within the existing facility’s model. Although his approach seemed to be effective and Clarion Court began illustrating some improvements, the organization still lagged behind in terms of performance. This compelled the board of directors to reconsider the initial suggestion of the former administrator, Myra Hahn.
On the other hand, the link between my task as a data analyst intern and the business problem is to examine how data analytics could have been utilized to resolve the challenge and inform decision-making (Galetsi et al., 2019).

We will classify infants into distinct eating behavior categories through observational studies and analysis of dietary records, focusing on factors such as hunger cues, feeding responsiveness, and satiety indicators. By comparing these behaviors to their respective weight gain trajectories during the first year, we will identify potential early markers for obesity risk in infants. This will elucidate opportunities to intervene at a formative stage, reducing the potential for overweight or obesity-associated issues in childhood and later life.

Specific Aim 2: Assess the Effects of Different Infant Feeding Practices on Weight Gain Velocity.
We will perform a longitudinal cohort study, examining various feeding practices, such as on-demand feeding, bottle-feeding, baby-led weaning, and feeding parent-led schedules, to determine their influence on rapid weight gain. This will provide crucial insight into the impact of different feeding strategies and, ultimately, inform the development of evidence-based recommendations for optimal infant feeding practices to mitigate obesity-related health risks.

We will evaluate visual field volumes in our retrospective IRD cohort and validate the results prospectively. Our goal is to use these outcomes to stratify patients by disease severity for upcoming clinical trials and determine whether volume analyses have the sensitivity to detect change in visual function through longitudinal clinical evaluation. The central hypothesis for this proposal is that the volume of visual field thresholds, serving as a surrogate endpoint, will capture disease severity and changes in visual function in patients with IRD. The objective of this proposal is to advance clinical trial readiness by validating a novel clinical outcome measure that quantifies the full visual field for rod and cone mediated vision, characterizing IRD patients for determining trial eligibility, and determining risk factors associated with disease severity and progression. To test our hypothesis and accomplish our overarching objective, we will address the following Specific Aims.
Specific Aim 1. To improve analysis of perimetry data, we will evaluate the sensitivity, efficacy, and feasibility of volumetric analyses of DAVFs. In this study, we will assess how accurately volumetric analyses of DAVF can be replicated based on a previous study that included 40 patients with IRD and 30 controls. Our evaluation will involve measuring intra- and inter-session repeatability coefficients (RC) for interpolated visual field volumes. We will also examine whether variations in grid patterns have an impact on volume analyses.
Specific Aim 2. To identify sensitive endpoints for IRD clinical trials, we will evaluate longitudinal DAVF and quantify disease progression. To prepare for future clinical trials, we previously performed a cross-sectional study from 2018-2021 using static perimetry, ophthalmic exams, and retinal imaging of 46 patients with a molecularly confirmed IRD diagnosis. In this aim, we will perform follow-up clinical evaluations including DAVFs to determine if volumetric analyses can detect change in visual function in well-characterized IRD patients.
Specific Aim 3. To identify factors for stratifying IRD patients in clinical trials we will evaluate the risk factors (genotype, phenotype, environmental, and comorbidities) associated with disease severity to stratify patients for clinical trials.

"","","","Topic: Artificial Intelligence, Subtopic: Generative Language Models","# The Technology Innovation

The grant writing process is an essential component for securing funding for non-profit organizations and academic institutions. However, the development of high-quality grant proposals is often an arduous and time-consuming task, requiring specialized knowledge and language patterns. Current language processing techniques struggle to capture these unique and context-dependent patterns, leading to suboptimal grant proposal quality and reduced success rates. Moreover, the identification of critical success factors, which contribute to the likelihood of grant proposal acceptance, often relies on the individual expertise of grant writers, further restricting the efficiency of the process. 

Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning hold great promise in overcoming these limitations. However, current AI-based solutions still fall short in understanding and generating context-aware language patterns, especially for specialized application domains like grant writing. Furthermore, the extraction of critical success factors from historical grant data remains a significant challenge, limiting our ability to enhance proposal quality and success rates.

To address these problems, we propose an AI-based grant writing assistant that leverages cutting-edge NLP techniques and machine learning models to streamline proposal creation, improve proposal quality, and increase grant approval rates. This innovative solution combines context-aware language processing with automated extraction of critical success factors from historical grant data, resulting in a more effective and efficient grant writing process. The R&D work involved in this project includes developing novel NLP techniques for grant-specific language patterns, designing machine learning models for critical success factor extraction, and integrating these components into a user-friendly grant writing assistant.

"","","","# The Technology Innovation

The grant writing process is an essential component for securing funding for non-profit organizations and academic institutions. However, the development of high-quality grant proposals is often an arduous and time-consuming task, requiring specialized knowledge and language patterns. Current language processing techniques struggle to capture these unique and context-dependent patterns, leading to suboptimal grant proposal quality and reduced success rates. Moreover, the identification of critical success factors, which contribute to the likelihood of grant proposal acceptance, often relies on the individual expertise of grant writers, further restricting the efficiency of the process. 

Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning hold great promise in overcoming these limitations. However, current AI-based solutions still fall short in understanding and generating context-aware language patterns, especially for specialized application domains like grant writing. Furthermore, the extraction of critical success factors from historical grant data remains a significant challenge, limiting our ability to enhance proposal quality and success rates.

To address these problems, we propose an AI-based grant writing assistant that leverages cutting-edge NLP techniques and machine learning models to streamline proposal creation, improve proposal quality, and increase grant approval rates. This innovative solution combines context-aware language processing with automated extraction of critical success factors from historical grant data, resulting in a more effective and efficient grant writing process. The R&D work involved in this project includes developing novel NLP techniques for grant-specific language patterns, designing machine learning models for critical success factor extraction, and integrating these components into a user-friendly grant writing assistant.

While many preclinical research programs focus on developing new IRD treatments, they often fail to reach the clinic due to the lack of sensitive endpoints that quantify change in structure or function of the retina. One way to overcome this limitation is by using perimetry to measure the threshold of visual function at different locations in the visual field thereby encompassing both rod- and cone-dominant diseases. However, traditional perimeters are by their small dynamic range of the stimulus, minimal testing areas, and inability to differentiate between rod and cone function, which has limited their use in clinical trials. In this proposal, we will use a perimeter without these limitations to investigate the relationships between dark-adapted visual fields and the volume of rod function. We will evaluate visual field volumes in our retrospective IRD cohort and validate the results prospectively. Our goal is to use these outcomes to stratify patients by disease severity for upcoming clinical trials and determine whether volume analyses have the sensitivity to detect change in visual function through longitudinal clinical evaluation. The central hypothesis for this proposal is that the volume of visual field thresholds, serving as a surrogate endpoint, will capture disease severity and changes in visual function in patients with IRD. The objective of this proposal is to advance clinical trial readiness by validating clinical outcome measures that quantify the full visual field for rod and cone mediated vision, characterizing IRD patients for determining trial eligibility, and determining risk factors associated with disease severity and progression.

Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs), which affect 5-10 million individuals worldwide, cause severe vision impairments that can lead to total blindness. Although there are around 300 genes linked to IRD, only one gene therapy, targeting the RPE65 gene, has received FDA approval. This milestone has spurred the development of additional IRD therapies, but most therapies tested in clinical trials fail to meet the trial endpoints, thus impeding their progress towards FDA approval. Our long-term goal is to develop more reliable and standardized trial endpoints that better capture the potential benefits of these therapies, increasing the chances of FDA approval of medicines to prevent or reverse blindness for patients with IRD.
Having specific clinical outcome measures and meaningful endpoints for detecting changes in retinal structure or visual function is crucial in testing treatments for IRD in human studies. Many preclinical research programs focus on developing new IRD treatments but fail to reach the clinic due to the lack of sensitive endpoints. To overcome this limitation, we need outcome measures that can isolate the exact location and size of the affected area, as well as quantify the extent of photoreceptor impairment in the central as well as the peripheral retina. Recent studies suggest that dark-adapted visual fields (DAVFs) may overcome these limitations and fill the critical gap in the need for functional endpoints in IRD clinical trials. In this proposal, we will investigate the relationships between DAVFs and the volume of rod function. We will evaluate volumetric indices in a retrospective IRD cohort and validate the results prospectively. The central hypothesis for this proposal is that the volume of visual field thresholds, serving as a surrogate endpoint, will capture disease severity and changes in visual function in patients with IRD. The objective of this proposal is to advance clinical trial readiness by validating a novel clinical outcome measure that quantifies the full visual field for rod and cone mediated vision, characterizing IRD patients for determining trial eligibility, and determining risk factors associated with disease severity and progression. To accomplish our overarching objective, we will address the following Specific Aims.
Specific Aim 1. To improve analysis of perimetry data, we will evaluate the sensitivity, efficacy, and feasibility of volumetric analyses of DAVFs. In this aim, we will determine the reliability of volumetric analyses of DAVFs. The hypothesis for this aim is that volumetric indices will have lower RCs than mean sensitivity. We will analyze DAVFs performed at the same clinical visit and again at a separate visit. The RCs for total and central field volumes will be calculated and compared to mean and pointwise sensitivity RCs. We will also simulate various grid patterns to determine impact on volume analyses.
Specific Aim 2. To identify sensitive endpoints for IRD clinical trials, we will evaluate longitudinal DAVF and quantify disease progression in a separate cross-sectional cohort. We clinically and genetically characterized 46 patients from 2018-2021. In this aim, we will perform follow-up clinical evaluations including measuring DAVFs, ophthalmic exams, and retinal imaging of molecularly confirmed IRD patients. We will test the hypothesis that volumetric analyses will detect changes in visual function in well-characterized IRD patients. 
Specific Aim 3. To identify strategies for stratifying IRD patients in clinical trials, we will evaluate the risk factors (genotype, phenotype, environmental, and comorbidities) associated with disease severity.
The completion of the proposed research has the potential to make a significant impact on the development of effective treatments for IRD. By validating perimetry analysis protocols, this research aims to provide specific clinical outcome measures and meaningful endpoints for detecting changes in visual function. Results from these studies will inform stratification strategies of patients for upcoming clinical trials, identify sensitive endpoints for IRD clinical trials, and determine risk factors associated with disease severity and progression. Ultimately, the completion of this research will improve the success rate of IRD treatments by providing a reliable and sensitive measure of treatment efficacy, accelerating the development of new therapies, and improving patient outcomes.

"","Paraphrase","","Background

Effective integration of home visit interventions focused on early childhood development into existing service platforms is important for expanding access in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We designed and evaluated a home visit intervention integrated into community health worker (CHW) operations in South Africa.
Methods and findings

We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial in Limpopo Province, South Africa. CHWs operating in ward-based outreach teams (WBOTs; clusters) and caregiver–child dyads they served were randomized to the intervention or control group. Group assignment was masked from all data collectors. Dyads were eligible if they resided within a participating CHW catchment area, the caregiver was at least 18 years old, and the child was born after December 15, 2017. Intervention CHWs were trained on a job aid that included content on child health, nutrition, developmental milestones, and encouragement to engage in developmentally appropriate play-based activities, for use during regular monthly home visits with caregivers of children under 2 years of age. Control CHWs provided the local standard of care. Household surveys were administered to the full study sample at baseline and endline. Data were collected on household demographics and assets; caregiver engagement; and child diet, anthropometry, and development scores. In a subsample of children, electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking measures of neural function were assessed at a lab concurrent with endline and at 2 interim time points. Primary outcomes were as follows: height-for-age z-scores (HAZs) and stunting; child development scores measured using the Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool (MDAT); EEG absolute gamma and total power; relative EEG gamma power; and saccadic reaction time (SRT)—an eye-tracking measure of visual processing speed. In the main analysis, unadjusted and adjusted impacts were estimated using intention-to-treat analysis. Adjusted models included a set of demographic covariates measured at baseline. On September 1, 2017, we randomly assigned 51 clusters to intervention (26 clusters, 607 caregiver–child dyads) or control (25 clusters, 488 caregiver–child dyads). At endline (last assessment June 11, 2021), 432 dyads (71%) in 26 clusters remained in the intervention group, and 332 dyads (68%) in 25 clusters remained in the control group. In total, 316 dyads attended the first lab visit, 316 dyads the second lab visit, and 284 dyads the third lab visit. In adjusted models, the intervention had no significant impact on HAZ (adjusted mean difference (aMD) 0.11 [95% confidence interval (CI): −0.07, 0.30]; p = 0.220) or stunting (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.63 [0.32, 1.25]; p = 0.184), nor did the intervention significantly impact gross motor skills (aMD 0.04 [−0.15, 0.24]; p = 0.656), fine motor skills (aMD −0.04 [−0.19, 0.11]; p = 0.610), language skills (aMD −0.02 [−0.18, 0.14]; p = 0.820), or social–emotional skills (aMD −0.02 [−0.20, 0.16]; p = 0.816). In the lab subsample, the intervention had a significant impact on SRT (aMD −7.13 [−12.69, −1.58]; p = 0.012), absolute EEG gamma power (aMD −0.14 [−0.24, −0.04]; p = 0.005), and total EEG power (aMD −0.15 [−0.23, −0.08]; p < 0.001), and no significant impact on relative gamma power (aMD 0.02 [−0.78, 0.83]; p = 0.959). While the effect on SRT was observed at the first 2 lab visits, it was no longer present at the third visit, which coincided with the overall endline assessment. At the end of the first year of the intervention period, 43% of CHWs adhered to monthly home visits. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were not able to assess outcomes until 1 year after the end of the intervention period.
Conclusions

While the home visit intervention did not significantly impact linear growth or skills, we found significant improvement in SRT. This study contributes to a growing literature documenting the positive effects of home visit interventions on child development in LMICs. This study also demonstrates the feasibility of collecting markers of neural function like EEG power and SRT in low-resource settings.

Project Narrative","1683558960623x543898430025236500","Six million Americans have heart failure (HF), a debilitating, chronic condition that is difficult to manage and profoundly impacts quality of life and survival. HF annually accounts for: (1) ~90,000 deaths; (2) 1.3M hospital discharges; and (3) disproportionately impacts marginalized (e.g., by race, poverty, and their intersection) populations. Costs of HF are estimated to reach ~$70 billion by 2030. Older HF patients have improved life expectancy and therefore increasingly face other age-related conditions. Among Medicare HF beneficiaries, 65% have ≥5 other chronic conditions, including many that are physiologically unrelated to HF. Collectively, these chronic conditions increase per capita spending 15-fold (0-1 conditions: $1,956; >5: $31,285).
Significant knowledge gaps remain in the evidence-based management of multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) for older HF patients, resulting in suboptimal clinical and financial outcomes, particularly for marginalized patient populations. These gaps may persist because of: (1) limitations of existing approaches for identifying high-risk HF patients and (2) misalignment between the MCCs experienced by HF patients and the focus of biomedical research. Commonly used reductionist approaches—including those of the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services—are typically based on a patient’s total and weighted MCC counts. These measures are limited in their ability to evaluate the impact of unique combinations of MCCs (e.g., HF+Arthritis) experienced by individual patients—hereafter their “HF-MCC profiles.” The application of Topological Data Analysis (TDA)—a novel technique for conducting combinatorial analyses in high-dimensional data—to Medicare claims and bibliometric (e.g., published studies) data would: (1) advance our understanding of the composition, structure, and impact of unique HF-MCC profiles (e.g., those disproportionately affecting marginalized populations) in clinical practice and (2) identify specific points of misalignment between prevalent HF-MCC combinations and their evaluation in biomedical research. Moreover, interventions aimed at optimizing evidence-based care for unique HF-MCC profiles and across marginalized populations require stakeholder (e.g., HF patients, caregivers, clinicians, researchers, relevant study section members) feedback to ensure relevant perspectives.
Our long-term goal is to achieve equitable care and outcomes for older adults with HF. The goal of this proposal, supported by our transdisciplinary team’s preliminary data and history of productive collaboration, addresses the overarching question: How do the structure and composition of HF-MCC profiles and their alignment or misalignment with biomedical research contribute to HF outcomes for older adults? We have the following specific aims. Aim 1: Leverage TDA to characterize the composition, structure, and outcomes associated with different HF-MCC profiles among Medicare beneficiaries with HF. Aim 2: Leverage TDA to identify and characterize misalignment between HF-MCC profiles and biomedical research.  Aim 3: Understand barriers and catalysts for advancing alignment of HF-MCC profiles with biomedical research in patients with HF.

Despite advances in treatment, many patients are often undertreated due to reluctance or inability to tolerate side effects from immunosuppressant drugs and biologics. Complex interplays between skin, immune response, genes, and the environment cause psoriasis, resulting in plaques and itching that impact mental health and results in other serious comorbidities. Effective treatments that target the root cause, minimize flare-ups, and improve the quality of life without severe side effects are crucial. Our technology presents a new avenue for developing such treatments, which could help alleviate the suffering of millions of people worldwide.","Focused Ultrasound Foundation - General Award Tracks","	Hypothesis: Focused ultrasound stimulation of the splenic nerve can reduce cytokine mediators that are implicated in autoimmune disease such as psoriasis. We can subsequently apply specific optimized parameter to a mouse model of psoriasis to treat acute and chronic disease. 
Focused ultrasound stimulation of the spenic nerve can reduce symptoms of autoimmune disease such as psoriasis in a mouse model of psoriasis. 
	Preliminary optimization: Optimize ultrasound stimulation parameters to reduce blood and skin cytokine levels in C57BL/6 healthy mice injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a general inflammatory model prior to moving to the KC-Tie2 genetic mouse model of psoriasis.
	Primary outcome measure: Reduction of dermal thickness in KC-Tie2 mouse model via ultrasound stimulation of the spleen as determined by histology.
	Secondary outcome measure: Reduction in specific pro-inflammatory cytokines (Il23, IL17, Il12, TNF-alpha and IL6) in the skin and the blood in the KC-Tie2 mouse model after ultrasound stimulation of the spleen as a direct quantitation of inflammation in psoriasis. 
	Specific aims: 
	AIM 1:  Optimize focused ultrasound parameters that can be used to modulate blood cytokine markers activated in psoriasis, including IL17, IL23, IL6 and TNFα a) in 40 healthy animals injected with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and subsequently b) in 20 KC-Tie2 mouse models using the optimized parameters. Both groups compared to a saline (sham) group using frequency around 0.9-1.3 MHz targeting the spleen/splenic nerve with different ultrasound pressures.
	AIM 2: Demonstrate modulation of inflammatory cytokine markers and thickness of skin samples using the optimized focused ultrasound parameters in a psoriasis mouse model. 
	AIM 3: Analyse the molecular changes in T-cells (e.g., Th17 and Tregs) in blood, spleen, skin, heart, liver and lymph-nodes via biochemical analysis in a psoriasis mouse model after focused ultrasound stimulation of the splenic nerve/spleen.

LPS injection has been shown to be an excellent animal model for systemic inflammation12. Previous evidence indicates that focused ultrasound is capable of reducing systemic inflammation by targeting the spleen to activate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, a neuro-immune mechanism involved in the regulation of inflammatory processes9.  Neurons from abdominal celiac ganglia project axons to the spleen through the splenic nerve terminating around splenic T cells. Activation of these nerve fibers release norepinephrine (NE) which triggers the release of acetylcholine (ACh) from specialized splenic T-cells. This, subsequently inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines from splenic macrophages in an α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR)-dependent manner and concurrently inhibits interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and TNF production from splenic macrophages to suppresses inflammation in animal models of acute and chronic inflammation (Figure 1A)8. These studies also demonstrate this effect exhibits a pressure dose response curve, suggesting the necessity to optimize the ultrasound stimulation parameters.
AIM 2: Demonstrate modulation of inflammatory cytokine markers and skin thickness using the optimized focused ultrasound parameters in a psoriasis mouse model. 
Rationale: There is ample evidence to suggest that psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin condition, is sustained by signals from the nervous system15. In previous studies, targeting the nervous system presents itself as a potential therapeutic option in improving clinical outcomes in patients and animal models of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)6,8. Based on these findings, the present study aims to investigate the feasibility and potential benefits of utilizing FUS to target not only the inflammatory markers associated with RA but also those specific to psoriasis, which are differ

Emerging evidence suggests that alterations in immune cell populations and function at the maternal-fetal interface may contribute to these complications. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these changes remain poorly understood. Our research aims to address this critical knowledge gap by investigating the impact of maternal obesity on immune cell dynamics and function at the maternal-fetal interface.

Our long-term goal is to improve pregnancy outcomes for obese women by identifying novel therapeutic targets and developing effective interventions. We hypothesize that maternal obesity alters immune cell populations, activation, and function at the maternal-fetal interface, leading to an imbalanced cytokine milieu and impaired immune cell-trophoblast interactions.

The technical solution is based on the idea that diatoms, which are photosynthetic microorganisms, can grow rapidly in the presence of nutrients and light, and can sequester significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. The technology involves using flue gas from coal-fired power plants to grow diatoms in an enclosed bioreactor system, and then processing the diatom biomass into biofuel.
The technical solution is currently in the proof-of-concept stage, and the proposed Phase I project will focus on further developing and optimizing the technology. Key technical challenges and risks associated with bringing the innovation to market include: (1) optimizing the bioreactor system to achieve optimal growth conditions for diatoms; (2) developing an efficient process for harvesting and processing the diatom biomass; (3) ensuring the removal of heavy metals and other contaminants from the coal waste and flue gas; and (4) scaling up the process to achieve commercial-scale production.
One of the key technical challenges is optimizing the bioreactor system to achieve optimal growth conditions for diatoms. This involves controlling various parameters such as nutrient concentration, temperature, light intensity, and pH. Another challenge is developing an efficient process for harvesting and processing the diatom biomass. This involves separating the diatoms from the water, drying and grinding the biomass, and extracting the oil.
Ensuring the removal of heavy metals and other contaminants from the coal waste and flue gas is also a critical aspect of the technical solution. Coal waste contains various heavy metals and other contaminants, which can be toxic to diatoms and other organisms. To address this, the coal waste will undergo a series of pretreatment steps to remove heavy metals and other contaminants, including using chelating agents and adsorbents. The membrane contactor system will also be designed to remove as much heavy metal as possible.
Scaling up the process to achieve commercial-scale production is another key technical challenge. This will require designing a bioreactor system that is scalable, and developing efficient processes for harvesting and processing the diatom biomass. It will also involve optimizing the overall process to achieve high productivity, low costs, and low environmental impact.
In summary, the proposed diatom-based biofuel project is a promising solution for converting coal waste into biofuels. The technical solution involves using flue gas from coal-fired power plants to grow diatoms in an enclosed bioreactor system, and then processing the diatom biomass into biofuel. Key technical challenges and risks associated with bringing the innovation to market include optimizing the bioreactor system, developing efficient processes for harvesting and processing the diatom biomass, ensuring the removal of heavy metals and other contaminants, and scaling up the process to achieve commercial-scale production. The project team plans to protect the intellectual property associated with the project by filing for patents and partnering with industry leaders in the field of biofuels and biotechnology
Another challenge is optimizing the diatom growth conditions. Diatoms require specific environmental conditions to thrive, including temperature, light, and nutrient availability. In order to maximize growth and lipid production, we will need to carefully control these factors. We plan to utilize a closed photobioreactor system that will allow us to precisely regulate temperature, light intensity, and nutrient concentrations. Additionally, we will conduct experiments to determine the optimal growth conditions for the selected diatom species, such as temperature and nutrient concentrations.
Another technical challenge is the scalability of the technology. While laboratory-scale experiments have shown promising results, scaling up the production process for commercialization will require significant engineering and design work. We will need to optimize the growth and harvesting process for larger-scale production and design and construct larger photobioreactors. We will also need to optimize the downstream processing steps, including lipid extraction and heavy metal removal, for larger volumes.
In conclusion, our proposed diatom-based biofuel technology has the potential to revolutionize the biofuels industry by utilizing a novel feedstock and providing a sustainable and eco-friendly source of fuel. However, there are significant technical challenges and risks associated with bringing this technology to market. Our Phase I project will focus on addressing these challenges and demonstrating the feasibility of the technology, laying the foundation for future commercialization efforts.
One of the key technical challenges of bringing this innovation to market is the need to achieve high conversion rates of carbon dioxide into biomass while maintaining high diatom productivity. The performance of the membrane contactor and the cultivation of diatoms are both critical components of the technology, and optimization of these processes will require extensive research and development efforts. In addition, the use of coal ash as a feedstock presents technical challenges related to the heavy metal removal process, which must be optimized to ensure safety and environmental sustainability.
To address these challenges, our focus in the proposed Phase I project will be on optimizing the membrane contactor and diatom cultivation processes. The scientific approach will involve a combination of experimentation and modeling to identify the optimal operating conditions for each process. Specifically, we will investigate the effects of various parameters such as flow rate, gas concentration, and membrane properties on the performance","Our team is in development of an oxygen infusion system to significantly increase the amount of free oxygen in water, which improves the living quality of aquatic life. This project has led us to the following achievements:
1. We have built and tested a functional system that can infuse Oxygen, CO2, and other gasses into water without a significant increase in total gas pressure. 
2. Our initial work has helped us understand key factors affecting microalgae health, and the necessity for high bioavailable nutrients. 
3. We have conducted safety training with contract services groups responsible for handling/transporting coal ash waste.

We would also like to identify high school senior that would make good CPR instructors and provide them with this training. ","CPR training empowers students by teaching them how to respond in an emergency. According to the American Heart Association, the chances of survival decrease by 10% for every minute that passes without CPR. We are increasing the number of people who can provide life-saving assistance in an emergency by teaching students how to perform CPR. This is especially important in rural areas, where emergency responders may arrive slower.

CPR training also helps students to develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills. CPR is a hands-on, practical skill requiring students to think critically and solve problems to save lives. It also requires teamwork and communication when multiple people perform CPR on the same person. These skills will serve students well in their future careers, regardless of their chosen field.

In addition, CPR training can also serve as a community service. By teaching students how to perform CPR, we are creating a new generation of responsible citizens who can provide life-saving assistance in an emergency. This can help to make our communities safer and more prepared for emergencies.

CPR training also helps students learn about heart health's importance. By learning about CPR, students will also learn about the heart's anatomy and how to recognize the signs of a heart attack. This knowledge can help students make healthier choices and be more aware of their heart health.

Cardiac arrests can happen anytime and anywhere. The chance of survival of a person having cardiac increases if he gets immediate medical attention. CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) is a life-saving technique that can be used to revive someone who has gone into cardiac arrest. Teaching CPR at the school level comes with great benefits.

Additionally, it is not clear how fasting affects the coordination of DNA repair with other cellular processes, such as cell cycle progression. Another question is whether fasting-induced DNA repair is a general phenomenon or if it is specific to certain cell types or tissues. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms underlying fast repair during fasting are not fully understood, and it is not clear whether fast repair is mediated by enzymatic or non-enzymatic mechanisms.

"","R01 - 2.1 Specific Aims","1684936235220x375433886575624200","Lipolytic regulation of dna repair","Aim 1: To characterize ATGL as a mediator of genomic stability in response to alterations in caloric intake. Given the reciprocal regulation of ATGL by caloric restriction or excess, we will utilize either ATGL KO or global knock-in mice along with dietary models of acute fasting, CR, or high-fat feeding to determine the contribution of ATGL as a modifier of dietary effects on the DNA damage response (DDR). We hypothesize that ATGL will be required for the beneficial effects of fasting and CR while ATGL overexpression will rescue the detriments of high-fat feeding on genomic stability.
Aim 2: To define the mechanism through which ATGL affects genomic stability. Our laboratory has previously identified that the lipid droplet protein perilipin 5 (PLIN5) and protein deacytelase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) form a key downstream signaling pathway that mediates ATGL-initiated lipid signaling. Thus, we will use both cell and mouse models to test the role of PLIN5, SIRT1, and lipid composition in linking ATGL-catalyzed lipolysis to alternations in genomic stability. We hypothesize that ATGL-generated monounsaturated fatty acids signal via PLIN5 and SIRT1 to enhance DNA repair.
Aim 3: To determine the role of ATGL in endogenous DNA damage. In addition to directly influencing DNA repair, the rewiring of metabolism in response to ATGL-catalyzed lipolysis may alter the formation of endogenous genotoxic stressors such as oxidative stress. Therefore, we will test the impact of ATGL on endogenous DNA damage utilizing cell and animal models with impaired DNA repair or attenuated oxidative stress. We hypothesize that ATGL reduces oxidative stress, in addition to enhancing DNA repair, to reduce genotoxic stress.
","The accumulation of DNA damage is a major contributing factor to aging and the development of countless metabolic and aging-related diseases. The balance between exogenous (e.g., UV light) or endogenous (e.g., oxidative stress) genotoxic agents and DNA repair control the frequency and extent of DNA damage. Loss of function mutations in DNA repair enzymes commonly leads to progeroid syndromes or cancer in both mouse models and in humans, highlighting the critical nature of maintaining genomic stability. Thus, defining mechanisms that regulate DNA damage and repair is paramount to minimizing the prevalence of aging-associated diseases. Diet is a major modifiable factor that influences health. Caloric restriction (CR) and/or fasting are established dietary interventions known to convey wide-ranging health benefits including resistance to numerous metabolic and aging-related diseases. In contrast, caloric excess (e.g., obesity) increases the risk of many diseases leading to morbidity and mortality. Whereas CR and fasting lead to improvements in DNA repair and genomic stability, caloric excess has the opposite effect. Yet, the mechanisms through which diet elicits these effects are not well understood. A hallmark of CR/fasting is profound changes in lipid metabolism with a robust increase in lipid catabolic pathways such as lipolysis with a simultaneous decrease in anabolic pathways. In contrast, lipolysis is reduced with obesity and aging. While lipolysis is often considered only in the context of adipose tissue and to simply function to provide fatty acids for oxidation and energy production, a growing body of literature reveals that lipolysis - in all cells - is a potent signaling node that influences a diverse range of cellular processes.

"","R01 - 2.2 Specific Aims","1684936235220x375433886575624200","The accumulation of DNA damage is a major contributing factor to aging and the development of countless metabolic and aging-related diseases. The balance between exogenous (e.g., UV light) or endogenous (e.g., oxidative stress) genotoxic agents and DNA repair control the frequency and extent of DNA damage. Loss of function mutations in DNA repair enzymes commonly leads to progeroid syndromes or cancer in both mouse models and in humans, highlighting the critical nature of maintaining genomic stability. Thus, defining mechanisms that regulate DNA damage and repair is paramount to minimizing the prevalence of aging-associated diseases.
	Diet is a major modifiable factor that influences health. Caloric restriction (CR) and/or fasting are established dietary interventions known to convey wide-ranging health benefits including resistance to numerous metabolic and aging-related diseases. In contrast, caloric excess (e.g., obesity) increases the risk of many diseases leading to morbidity and mortality. Whereas CR and fasting lead to improvements in DNA repair and genomic stability, caloric excess has the opposite effect. Yet, the mechanisms through which diet elicits these effects are not well understood. A hallmark of CR/fasting is profound changes in lipid metabolism with a robust increase in lipid catabolic pathways such as lipolysis with a simultaneous decrease in anabolic pathways. In contrast, lipolysis is reduced with obesity and aging. While lipolysis is often considered only in the context of adipose tissue and to simply function to provide fatty acids for oxidation and energy production, a growing body of literature reveals that lipolysis - in all cells - is a potent signaling node that influences a diverse range of cellular processes. Herein, we identify lipolysis is a potent modulator of genomic stability. Overexpression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the primary triacylglycerol lipase in most cells, prevents DNA damage and the ensuing induction of senescence. Moreover, preventing the formation of lipid droplets (LDs), the lipid storage organelle that supplies substrates for lipolysis, exacerbates DNA damage and senescence induction. RNA sequencing of drosophila overexpressing their ATGL homolog identifies robust increases in transcripts of proteins involved in DNA repair. Collectively, these data show for the first time that ATGL-catalyzed lipid catabolism is a key regulator of genomic stability. Thus, the objective of these studies is to mechanistically define how ATGL mediates the effects of diet on DNA damage and repair. We hypothesize that ATGL-mediated lipid signaling is a key regulator of genomic stability and a mediator of caloric-limited and excessive diets. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims. 
Aim 1: To characterize ATGL as a mediator of genomic stability in response to alterations in caloric intake. Given the reciprocal regulation of ATGL by caloric restriction or excess, we will utilize either ATGL KO or global knock-in mice along with dietary models of acute fasting, CR, or high-fat feeding to determine the contribution of ATGL as a modifier of dietary effects on the DNA damage response (DDR). We hypothesize that ATGL will be required for the beneficial effects of fasting and CR while ATGL overexpression will rescue the detriments of high-fat feeding on genomic stability.
Aim 2: To define the mechanism through which ATGL affects genomic stability. Our laboratory has previously identified that the lipid droplet protein perilipin 5 (PLIN5) and protein deacytelase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) form a key downstream signaling pathway that mediates ATGL-initiated lipid signaling. Thus, we will use both cell and mouse models to test the role of PLIN5, SIRT1, and lipid composition in linking ATGL-catalyzed lipolysis to alternations in genomic stability. We hypothesize that ATGL-generated monounsaturated fatty acids signal via PLIN5 and SIRT1 to enhance DNA repair.

","Our team is developing an innovative water desalination system that combines reverse osmosis (RO) and capacitive deionization (CDI) to address the growing need for clean drinking water. Our preliminary work has led to the following achievements:
1. We built and tested a small-scale prototype of the hybrid RO-CDI system, which showed improved energy efficiency and desalination performance compared to traditional RO systems.
2. Our initial work has helped us understand key factors affecting the performance of the hybrid RO-CDI system, such as optimal operating conditions and component selection.
3. We filed a provisional patent application for our hybrid RO-CDI technology.
4. We published our early findings in a peer-reviewed journal, showcasing the potential benefits of the hybrid RO-CDI system over conventional desalination methods.

The progress made so far demonstrates the potential of our hybrid RO-CDI system and lays a strong foundation for the proposed R&D plan. Our next steps include scaling up the technology and conducting further tests to validate its real-world performance.

"","R01 - 5.1 Research Strategy - Significance","1684945736850x864653528924422100","Asthma is a multifactorial disease characterized by inflammation, airway remodeling and hyperresponsiveness that affects over 6.5% of Americans younger than 18 years old1. Minority children with asthma in urban areas are particularly affected by acute asthma episodes, which result in missed school, lower academic achievement, and higher health costs2. While medication can improve daily symptoms, asthma is heterogeneous, and the severity of the disease is highly dependent on an individual’s environment3. Asthma exacerbations can be triggered by a broad range of well characterized environmental factors, such as allergens and irritants4, yet there remain other exposures, such as toxic metals, whose impact on asthma exacerbations is not well understood. 

Humans are exposed to metals in complex mixtures via diet, water, cosmetics, pollution, and tobacco smoke5–8. Some toxic metals (e.g. arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), and lead (Pb)) have individually been previously linked to childhood asthma, severity of asthma symptoms, and decreased pulmonary function9–12, however, findings have been inconsistent, and the extent to which metals as mixtures contribute to asthma exacerbations among asthmatic children is not well understood. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms by which metals impact asthma exacerbations are poorly characterized, leaving a major gap in our ability to prevent or treat metals-induced asthma exacerbations for millions of children. During an asthma exacerbation, cells in the respiratory tract experience increased inflammation, oxidative stress, and dysregulated immune function13, however, this is difficult to study in humans. Accessible biomarkers reflecting these altered processes are extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their encapsulated micro-RNAs (miRNAs). EVs are nano-sized, membrane-bound vesicles that participate in intercellular communication via transfer of material, such as miRNAs, from cell to cell. miRNAs are small, single stranded, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. Previous work has demonstrated the impact of miRNA expression and function on asthma13–15, but has not focused on EV-miRNAs as an informative biomarker of asthma exacerbations in asthmatic children. Metals have also been previously associated with the release of EVs and their miRNA content, though most of this work has been conducted in vitro16. Characterization of these complex relationships could lead to better asthma management and early identification of asthmatic children at greater risk of exacerbations.

I propose that saliva EV-miRNAs can provide insight into the molecular mechanism by which metal exposure impacts asthma exacerbations and inform development of mechanistic biomarkers for asthma exacerbations. My objective is to determine, among asthmatic children, whether (1)metals (as, cd, cr, pb), individually and as a mixture, are associated with asthma exacerbations, (2) metals are associated with EV-miRNAs, and (3) EV-miRNAs are associated with asthma exacerbations – specifically, if those associated with metal exposure serve as a predictive biomarker of asthma exacerbations. I will leverage the existing NIH-funded School Inner-City Asthma Study-2 (SICAS-2), a longitudinal study focused on allergen exposure in school environments and asthma morbidity amongst asthmatic children in the Northeastern US. Asthma-related health was assessed at baseline and a 10 month follow up visit. Saliva, an easily-accessible biofluid with the benefit of proximity to the respiratory tract, was also collected at baseline. Lab analyses of saliva metals (N=195), via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and saliva EV-miRNAs (N=187), via next-generation sequencing, are complete. This longitudinal study provides a unique opportunity to identify new biomarkers to better inform asthma treatment amongst urban asthmatic children. To examine these relationships, I propose the following specific aims:

Aim 1: Determine whether metals measured in saliva are associated, individually and in mixtures, with asthma exacerbations in urban, asthmatic children. Hypothesis: Children with higher levels of metals (as, cd, cr, pb) in saliva have more severe asthma symptoms (number of symptom days within a 2-week period, Composite Asthma Severity Index Score, and lower performance on pulmonary function tests).

Aim 2: Determine whether metals measured in saliva, individually and in mixtures, are associated with saliva EV-miRNA profiles. Hypothesis: Higher levels of metals (as, cd, cr, pb) in saliva are associated with EV-miRNAs related to inflammation, oxidative stress, and immune cell activation.  

Aim 3: Characterize the roles of EV-miRNAs on the path linking metal exposure to asthma exacerbations. Hypothesis 3a: Saliva EV-miRNA profiles are associated with asthma symptoms. Exploratory Hypothesis 3b: Saliva EV-miRNA signatures associated with toxic metals are associated with asthma symptoms, and predict the severity of asthma exacerbations in urban asthmatic children. 

Impact: The proposed study will be the first to investigate associations between saliva metals and asthma exacerbations with EV-miRNAs in saliva. These findings will contribute to the growing body of work focused on environmental metal exposure and children’s health, and potentially help to better inform asthma management with identification of a predictive biomarker of asthma exacerbation amongst asthmatic children.

","A.1. Asthma exacerbations are a major public health concern. As of 2021, asthma affected 6.5% of children younger than 18 years old in the US. Of these children with asthma, nearly 43% experienced one or more asthma exacerbations in the prior year17. During an asthma exacerbation, an individual’s airway becomes swollen and inflamed, causing the throat to narrow, and resulting in decreased oxygen in the lungs. In addition to stress and reduced quality of life, exacerbations result in increased healthcare costs, progressive loss of lung function, and routine use of inhaled corticosteroid medication 2. Despite proper treatment, asthmatic children can still experience exacerbations, and it is important to identify those most at risk to form better asthma management plans.

A.2. Metal exposure is ubiquitous and has potential for harm among children with asthma. Children are chronically exposed to metals through water, air, food, and personal care products5,10,18. Heavy metals can accumulate in tissues, organs, and bones where they impact biological processes throughout the body10. Increased exposure to toxic environmental metals, including as, cd, cr, and pb has been associated with nose and throat irritation, coughing, wheezing, and dyspnea19. Given exposure to metals is so widespread, there is a need to better understand the effect of metal mixtures on asthma exacerbations to better inform asthma management and treatment.

A.3 EV-miRNAs are a novel prognostic biomarker in assessing risk of asthma exacerbations among asthmatic children. The exact mechanisms by which toxic metals impact asthma exacerbations among asthmatic children are not well understood, though metal exposure is believed to modulate immune, oxidative, and inflammatory systems, which can result in exacerbation of existing respiratory conditions18. Circulating saliva EVs and their encapsulated miRNAs may be reflective of inflammatory processes in the respiratory system and provide a biological link between metal exposure and asthma. EVs are nano-sized (0.03-2μm), membrane vesicles that occur naturally from cells in all organs of the body, and facilitate cell to cell communication. EVs contain small, non-coding miRNAs (18-25 nucleotides) that play a role in mRNA regulation and can be sent from one cell to another to alter biological activity. miRNAs within EVs have been shown to modulate immunologic processes and trigger an inflammatory cascade that may contribute to airway remodeling20. EVs and EV-miRNAs are implicated in asthma, however no study has examined saliva metals, EV-miRNAs, and asthma exacerbations in asthmatic children. 

A.4. Saliva is a unique and useful biofluid to examine metal exposure and EV-miRNAs in children with asthma. Saliva is a powerful diagnostic tool as it is collected in a non-invasive manner and contains information on a robust matrix of exposures and molecular markers. Saliva functions very similarly to blood in assessing the body’s psychological state, and most compounds found in blood, including metals, proteins, genetic material, and EVs, are also present in saliva21. Toxic metals cd, cr, as, and pb can diffuse from blood capillaries into saliva ducts. Saliva also comes into direct contact with metals in air and water, especially in children, given they are predominantly mouth breathers4. Also, salivary biomarkers have been used to characterize several systemic inflammatory diseases. For example, saliva has elevated levels of IgE in asthmatics compared to controls and contains inflammatory proteins expressed in the asthmatic airway22. Additionally, saliva is particularly relevant as a non-invasive material to assess metals and asthma exacerbations as it is produced in the oral cavity, which is directly connected to the upper airway. Previous work has demonstrated that proteins found in breath condensate, produced from the lower airway, are very similar to those in saliva23, suggesting a similarity in the biomolecules and contaminants found in secretions of the airway and saliva. 

A.5. Innovation and public health impact. The proposed study is highly innovative. It (1) will be the first to investigate saliva metals, EV-miRNAs, and asthma exacerbations in asthmatic children and (2) will utilize saliva, a non-invasive biofluid, as a source of EVs and metals. Saliva provides a unique window to systemic health, especially health connected to airways, which will yield novel information about lung function and health that is typically difficult to assess without invasive techniques such as collection of bronchial alveolar lavage fluid. My research will add to the growing body of evidence that saliva can be used as a safe and painless diagnostic tool to examine an individual’s response to environmental exposures. The proposed study will also (3) utilize RNA-Seq data generated via circular amplification, an emerging high-throughput method for performing miRNA profiling with minimal bias and (4) leverage saliva metal concentrations measured via a sensitive ICP-MS method to accurately reflect a personalized metal exposure. The proposed study will examine the effects of recent metal exposure on an easily obtainable biomarker in saliva as well as associations between the metal exposure and asthma morbidity, independently and in combination with a molecular biomarker of exposure. This knowledge will allow us to predict, amongst children with asthma, those most at risk of asthma exacerbations and better inform treatment. This study has high potential to better our understanding of the epigenetic regulations of asthma exacerbations, and elucidate a non-invasive approach to identifying high risk asthmatic children.
","B.1. Cohort Infrastructure. The existing School Inner-City Asthma Study (SICAS-2) cohort offers a unique and cost-effective opportunity to address the proposed aims. Saliva metal measurement, EV-miRNA assessment, and asthma outcomes have all been previously measured in SICAS-2, requiring no additional resources for data collection (Table X).

B.1.a. Cohort Overview. SICAS-2 was originally designed as a randomized controlled trial in the Northeastern 
US with a factorial design to test whether school-based interventions intended to mitigate school pollutant exposure reduce asthma morbidity. The study population consists of children 4-15 years old, of English- or Spanish-speaking families, who attend inner-city metropolitan schools in the Northeastern US. Participants (n = 236) were recruited between 2015-2020 and followed for 10 months. I will not assess the effects of the intervention, as saliva was only collected during the baseline visit, but rather will examine metal exposure with saliva biomarkers and longitudinal lung function. Children with a physician’s diagnosis of asthma and evidence of active asthma were eligible for the study. Experience of ≥1 of the following in the 12 months prior to enrollment qualified as active asthma: asthma-related unscheduled visit to an emergency department, clinic, or urgent care facility, asthma-related overnight hospitalization, and bursts of oral or injectable corticosteroids. These criteria were modeled from the Inner-City Asthma Consortium funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Exclusion criteria included: taking a 𝛽-blocker, presence of cardiovascular disease or lung disease (other than asthma) that requires daily medication, and inability to comply with study protocol (e.g., moving schools). The effects of the intervention have already been assessed24. As saliva was only collected during the baseline visit, I will not consider the effects of the intervention, but rather will examine metal exposure with saliva biomarkers and longitudinal lung function. There are 195 children with metal measures and asthma outcomes, 187 children have metal measures and EV-miRNA measures, and 169 children have metal, EV-miRNA, and asthma outcomes measured. There is no overlap of my proposed research with the parent U01 grant, which did not include EV-miRNA, nor metals, research. 

B.2. Data Collection. The SICAS-2 collected data and saliva samples are very well-suited to test the association of metals with EV-miRNA and asthma morbidity because of the study’s detailed characterization of several exposures and outcomes. As noted in Table 1, at baseline, informed consent was obtained and asthma related health outcomes, general health outcomes including anthropometric measures, and medication use were collected via parent questionnaires, allergy skin testing to 14 common allergens was completed, and spirometry measures were taken in accordance with the American Thoracic Society standards. At follow up, parent questionnaires regarding asthma related health outcomes were re-administered, as well as spirometry and the Composite Asthma Severity Index (CASI). Asthma morbidity outcomes for this study are based on previously published work from SICAS-2 and are outlined in Table 224. The primary outcomes are pulmonary function, maximum number of symptom days within a two-week period, and the Composite Asthma Severity Index (a comprehensive severity scale of symptoms and albuterol use during the day, symptoms and albuterol use during the night, controller treatment, lung function measures, and exacerbations), school absence due to asthma within a two-week period, and health care use throughout the study period.

B.3. Saliva sample collection. Saliva was collected by a SICAS-2 study team member at a participant’s baseline visit. Children were instructed to chew on parafilm for one minute while swallowing normally. After this minute, participants were asked to stop swallowing while continuing to chew, to allow buildup of saliva in the mouth. Every 30 seconds, or as needed, the participant was instructed to expectorate the saliva into a falcon tube until at least 6 mL of saliva was collected. Time of day, collection time, saliva volume, and food or drink in the last hour was recorded. Samples were either immediately frozen at -80°C as whole saliva or centrifuged at 13,000-14,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C to separate cell-free saliva supernatant from a saliva pellet containing cells and debris, after which they were separated and frozen. Samples were shipped to Columbia University throughout the study period and kept frozen at -80°C until sample processing. 

B.4. Preliminary Studies, and Methods (by Aim):
B.4.a. Aim 1: Determine whether metals measured in saliva are associated, individually and in mixtures, with asthma exacerbations in urban, asthmatic children. NoteablyNotably, members of our team have been leaders in metal mixtures research and children’s health. (cite all mixtures papers) One of my mentors, Dr. Kupsco, previously examined the role of prenatal exposure to metals with childhood cardiometabolic risk factors. The overall impact of a metal mixture was assessed, as were interactions between metals. This work assessed linear associations of each metal with individual z- scores and used Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression to investigate metal mixtures and interactions. Metals during pregnancy were associated with increased cardiometabolic risk factors during childhood.

Measurement of metal biomarker: Metals were measured in saliva using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) modeled after previously validated methods25–28 . Saliva pellets were thawed on ice and nitric acid was added to each sample to facilitate digestion. Digested pellets were then transferred to metal-free vials where an internal standard and gold were added. Samples were measured on ICP-MS in oxygen mode (As, Cd), ammonia mode (Cr), and no additional gas mode (Pb). All measurements were adjusted taking into consideration internal standards, background calibration, and blanks. NIST Trace elements in water was used as the certified reference material. Blank measurements were taken twelve times, and the method detection limit was determined using the threshold: standard deviation x 3.33 x dilution factor.

Preliminary Data: Saliva metal measurements proved to be robust and fall within the expected range of metals for children of this age. As seen in Figure 2, across all metals, all samples read more than 80% above the limit of detection (LOD). The recovery was ** and these values were based on a standard curve with values of **. Some samples were read across multiple days and there was a CV of **. In preliminary analyses of the cross-sectional relationship between metals and FEV1/FVC within SICAS, higher levels of arsenic were significantly associated with a lower FEV/FVC ratio (β = -1.24 L, 95% CI: -2.37 L, -0.13 L) when adjusting for relevant covariates as shown in (Figure 3). This is consistent with previous research on arsenic As and lung function in adults that demonstrated a similar relationship29.

B.4.b. Aim 2: Determine whether metals measured in saliva, individually and in mixtures, are associated with saliva EV-miRNA profiles. While working with my mentor, Dr. Baccarelli, we recently isolated and characterized EVs and EV-miRNA from saliva samples collected as part of SICAS-2, the cohort of school aged asthmatic children in the Northeastern US that will be further investigated in this study30. This was the first characterization of saliva EVs from children with asthma. Additionally,  my mentor team has demonstrated an abundance of evidence linking environmental exposures to changes in EVs and their miRNA content, from air pollution to stress31–35. 

Saliva EV and EV-miRNA isolation: Guidelines set forth by the Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (MISEV) were adhered to throughout EV isolation and characterization. Saliva was thawed on ice and whole saliva was centrifuged using the same protocol employed by SICAS-2 staff during collection to create saliva supernatant and pellet samples. EVs were isolated from saliva supernatant using the System Biosciences ExoQuick-TC kit to improve rigor and reproducibility, and avoid variability seen with ultracentrifugation. EV morphology and biochemical composition was validated with transmission electron morphology (TEM), nanoparticle particle tracking analysis (NTA), and capillary immunoassays 30. RNA was then isolated from EVs using the Qiagen miRNeasy Micro kit. Quality and yield of isolated RNA was measured with the Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA Assay and a subset of samples were further quantified with the Agilent Bioanalyzer Eukaryotic 2100 small RNA kit to assess proportion of miRNA within the sample. Library preparation was completed with a custom RealSeq-AC library prep kit, a novel circular amplification method that minimizes bias typically observed in library prep 36.Small RNA sequencing was performed at RealSeq Biosciences. Library preparation was completed with a custom RealSeq-AC library prep kit, a novel circular amplification method that minimizes bias typically observed in library prep 36.

Bioinformatics and processing of miRNA sequencing data: miRNA sequencing quality will be assessed manually and automatically using fastQC v0.11.837 and multiQC v1.738. Adaptors will be trimmed from all reads that pass initial quality control measures using cutadapt v2.3 39 and filtered such that the minimum read length is 17 nt. Reads will then be assessed against the genomic reference GRCh38.p14 provided by Ensembl using bowtie v1.2.2 40and miRDeep2 v2.0.1.241 with allowance for two mismatches. miRBase v22.1.42, will then be used to filter for microRNAs specific to human sapiens, allowing for one mismatch.

"","R01 - 5.1 Research Strategy - Significance","1685412022059x119488366804467710","Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with atrial fibrillation (AF) being the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and time-restricted eating (TRE) have shown promise in improving cardiac function and reducing atrial arrhythmias. However, the effects of these interventions on left atrial (LA) function and cardiometabolic measures remain unclear. Addressing this knowledge gap is crucial for developing effective therapies to reduce the burden of cardiovascular diseases.

Our long-term goal is to identify novel therapeutic strategies that improve cardiac function and reduce atrial arrhythmias, in line with the National Institutes of Health's mission to enhance health and reduce the burden of illness. We hypothesize that SGLT2i and TRE interventions will result in significant improvements in LA function, reduction in atrial arrhythmias, and favorable cardiometabolic profiles. Our central hypothesis is based on preliminary data and published literature demonstrating the potential benefits of SGLT2i and TRE on cardiovascular health. Our multidisciplinary team, with expertise in cardiology, endocrinology, and nutrition, is uniquely positioned to conduct this research and translate our findings into clinical practice.

Aim#1: Evaluate SGLT2i effects on cardiac structure and function (especially LA function), atrial arrhythmias, and cardiometabolic measures. H1: As compared with control, SGLTi results in greater improvement in LA function, reduction in atrial arrhythmias, and more favorable cardiometabolic profile at 3 months and 6 months.
Aim#2: Evaluate TRE effects on cardiac structure and function (especially LA function), atrial arrhythmias, and cardiometabolic measures. H2: As compared with control, weight

Our study is innovative in its comprehensive assessment of the effects of SGLT2i and TRE on cardiac structure and function, atrial arrhythmias, and cardiometabolic measures. We will employ state-of-the-art imaging techniques and biomarker analyses to evaluate the impact of these interventions on LA function and atrial arrhythmias. We expect that SGLT2i and TRE will result in significant improvements in LA function, reduction in atrial arrhythmias, and favorable cardiometabolic profiles at 3 and 6 months. These findings will provide valuable insights into the potential benefits of SGLT2i and TRE as therapeutic strategies for patients with cardiovascular diseases.

The successful completion of our aims will have a significant impact on the field by providing evidence-based recommendations for the use of SGLT2i and TRE in the management of cardiovascular diseases. Our findings will inform clinical guidelines and contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies, ultimately improving the quality of life for millions of patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases.
