Absolutely—here’s a new, step‑by‑step build plan that an AI (or contractor) can follow to ship a beautiful, polished, interactive SBIR/STTR Autopilot that feels magical. It focuses on the experience (delight + clarity) while keeping the implementation lean. Each step includes objective → rationale → exact tasks → prompts → polish/animation → acceptance criteria. The plan assumes your current Next.js/Vercel/Prisma stack.

## North‑Star Experience (what users feel)

* They land on a clean page and click “Autowrite my SBIR”.
* A 3‑step cinematic onboarding gathers only the minimum (pack, 6 quick answers, optional docs).
* They see a Magic Progress overlay: the AI does everything (draft → fill gaps → tighten → review → apply safe fixes) with lively status updates.
* They arrive in a calm, single‑canvas workspace with a complete draft, a small list of Top Fixes, and the ability to export.

# DESIGN SYSTEM (build once, reuse everywhere)

Typography: Plus Jakarta Sans (or Inter), headings 600.
Color tokens (CSS variables): see README for code.
Visual style: dark, minimalist, soft radius, subtle glass on overlays.
Animations: Framer Motion (opacity/translate, 150–250ms).
Microcopy tone: warm, reassuring, “We’re on it.”

# ROADMAP (6 compact, shippable milestones)

Keep each milestone deployable. No feature flags; just ship.

- [ ] M1 — “Cinematic” Onboarding Wizard
- [ ] M2 — “Single‑Click Magic” Autopilot (orchestrator + overlay)
- [ ] M3 — “Magic Canvas” Workspace (clean, calm, powerful)
- [ ] M4 — “Beautiful Facts” & Smart Insert
- [ ] M5 — “Elegant Tightening” & Safe‑Guarded Coverage
- [ ] M6 — “Delightful Output” DOCX & Mini Demo Mode

Each milestone has Objective, Rationale, Tasks, Prompts, Polish, Acceptance Criteria in README (implementation notes) and comments in code.
