# Deprecated components

These components underpin the older multi-pane UX (ChatKit-style editor, sidebar, and right rail). They remain in the tree for reference during the prototype transition and should be removed once the AgentWorkspace flow covers every screen.

- `editor/`, `right-rail/` – legacy draft editor shell
- `projects/`, `grants/`, `assistant/`, `sidebar/`, `citations/` – supporting widgets for the old dashboard

Feel free to migrate code out of this folder or delete it entirely after the next milestone.
