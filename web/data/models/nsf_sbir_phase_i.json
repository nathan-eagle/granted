        "[b]Technical Objectives and Challenges:[/b]\nList 2-3 goals you intend to reach to prove the feasibility of your innovation.\n\nTechnical Objectives are the goals you intend to reach to prove feasibility or proof of concept for your innovation. The NSF is looking for development projects that involve a high degree of technical risk. They define that as something that has never before been attempted or successfully done, or something that still faces significant technical hurdles. These should be SCIENCE problems, not engineering problems. Engineering problems have all the required formulas, equations, technology, techniques, processes and theory already developed, established, and accepted. Science problems do NOT have established and accepted formulas, equations, technology, techniques, processes or theory. This makes for a very different kind of problem. Establishing feasibility of a new science problem will inevitably push forward the state of the art. These are the types of problems NSF wants to fund. \n\n[i]Example:[/i] \n[quote]1. Establish novel approaches for context-aware language processing that enable AI to adapt to the unique and specialized language patterns in grant proposals, pushing the boundaries of current natural language processing techniques. 2.

Each Scientific Risk should be briefly summarized and should have subsections for 'Importance' and 'How this risk will be addressed in Phase I'.\n- Each Technical Objective should have at least one quantitative success criterion.\n- This section should be between 400 and 800 words in length.\n\nExample format for this section:\n[h3]Key Technical Challenges and Risks[/h3]\n\n[b]Scientific Risk #1:[/b] Accurately identifying and characterizing research and technical topics using the extensive Curtin Open Knowledge Initiative (COKI) dataset is unprecedented. Success would result in the first global citation-based topical model built solely on an open dataset of this magnitude and the first to cover fields beyond biomedicine.\n[b]Importance:[/b]\nDefining the search domain's boundaries is crucial for identifying expertise. The project's primary challenge is to programmatically identify quantitative, defensible research and technological topics with market acceptance. Utilizing an open dataset containing multiple data sources allows us to create a larger model than those based on proprietary citation databases, maintain control over raw data, and freely incorporate additional technical information in future iterations.\n[b]How this risk will be addressed in Phase I:[/b]\nThe initial technical objective is to demonstrate that the COKI Open Access Dataset can be partitioned into topics similar to the leading commercial model. Success will be measured by 80% of core papers in the leading commercial model also being identified as core papers in the COKI model, indicating comparable classification effectiveness.\n\n[b]Scientific Risk #2:[/b] <summary of the scientific risk 2>\n[b]Importance:[/b]\n<Importance of overcoming this challenge / justification of the risk>\n[b]How this risk will be addressed in Phase I:[/b]\n<How this risk will be addressed and/or mitigated in Phase I>\n\n[i]To establish feasibility of our concept, we propose the following Technical Objectives:[/i]\n\n[b]Technical Objective 1.[/b] [i]Prove that the COKI Open Access Dataset can be partitioned into topics similar to those of the leading commercial model.[/i]\n[b]Acceptance Criterion:[/b] 80% of the papers most central to topics within the leading commercial model will also be the most central to the COKI model. In other words, the papers representing topic cores in the leading commercial model will also be identified as core papers in the COKI model.\n\n[b]Technical Objective 2.[/b] [i]Demonstrate that the COKI model can accurately retrieve relevant expert names and related technical information by keyword search.[/u]\n[b]Acceptance Criterion:[/b] The COKI model identifies the top 20 experts in the area of nuclear decommissioning with an accuracy equivalent to the 75th percentile of practitioners and experts surveyed in this topic.'\n\n[h3]Status of the Intellectual Property[/h3]\n\nUse your knowledge and creativity to write an effective 'Status of the Intellectual Property' subsection. Refer to the [Elevator Pitch] and [Status of Intellectual Property] provided above for context and detail. This subsection should:\n\n- Describe the current status of your intellectual property associated with this project.\n- Describe how you plan to protect IP going forward.\n- Mention any \u201cfreedom to operate\u201d or other IP searches (formal or informal) you have conducted.\n- Mention the IP counsel you use. If the counsel's name has not been provided, use '[Your IP Counsel's Name]' as a placeholder.\n\nExample: \n'The intellectual property (IP) for our AI-based grant writing assistant is currently protected by a provisional patent application, filed on MM-DD-YYYY. We have conducted both formal and informal freedom-to-operate searches, which indicate that our technology does not infringe upon existing patents in the field. As we continue to develop the technology, we plan to work with our IP counsel, Jane Johnson from Johnson & Associates, to further assess the patent landscape, file any necessary additional patents, and ensure that our IP is adequately protected throughout the project's development.'\n\n[h3]NSF Lineage[/h3]\n\nUse your knowledge and creativity to write an effective 'NSF Lineage' subsection. Refer to the [NSF Lineage] provided above for context and detail. This subsection should:\n\n- List the title, NSF award number, and division for previous NSF-funded research projects that have indirectly made your idea possible.\n\nAfter the NSF Lineage header, write 'This project is based on the following NSF lineage:' then list the relevant NSF projects.\n\nIt is highly desirable that the core innovation described in your proposal can in some manner be linked to fundamental research previously funded by the NSF. Therefore, if the [NSF Lineage] provided above is missing or is insufficient to produce a list of projects including the title, year, and award number for each project, then write 'Go to https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/simpleSearch.jsp to find previously funded NSF grants relevant to your proposal. List them in this section, including the title, year, division, and NSF award number for each.'\n\n[h3]NSF I-Corps Lineage[/h3]\n\nSimply write 'Did your project team participate in an I-Corps cohort (regional or national)? \nIf so, identify the host organization as follows: 'This team has participated in an I-Corps activity hosted by [enter host organization here] with award number [enter award number here]. If you need the award number, please contact the host organization. Note that I-Corps participation is not required. Don't include this section if it's not applicable to you.'\n\nUse your knowledge and creativity to create a compelling Technical Solution while integrating necessary background information whenever needed.",
