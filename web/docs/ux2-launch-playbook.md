# UX2 Launch Playbook

1. Promote the new workspace UI to 100% of traffic (feature flag retired) and monitor `coverage.delta`, `tighten.applied`, and export success via event logs.
2. Publish help article "How to use the conversational workspace" (ready in Notion, include video walkthrough).
3. Gather feedback through the in-product drawer (Feedback button in workspace footer uploads screenshot + request id).
4. Support playbook covers parser troubleshooting, OCR fallback instructions, and conflict resolution workflow.
